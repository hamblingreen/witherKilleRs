# witherKilleRs
"WitherKilleRs.R" by hamblingreen: A script relying on pacman and rbedrock-loadR.r to find natural wither killers in your minecraft: bedrock edition worlds. All credit for developing rbedrock goes to Rufus Atticus, I made this script as a user-friendly adaptation of the ability to find wither killers built into rbedrock.
